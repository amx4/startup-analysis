# Predicting Startup Funding Rounds via Tweets

For the average public relations officer, manipulating the media is a standby. Social media is no exception, with sites like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook now regular tools in a publicist's arsenal. Raising brand awareness and positive sentiment may be especially important before important events like a startup's Series B. We propose to test the converse: Before financing rounds, might there be an abnormal amount of PR activity? Can we predict details on events like financing rounds based on mentions of a company on social media platforms like Twitter?

This project allows users to test our hypothesis by downloading Twitter mentions of companies and scraping startup financial data from investment site Crunchbase, and then running them through a comparative model.
